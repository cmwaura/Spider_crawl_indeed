Red_Scrap_Spider Documentation
==============================
Introduction and Background.
----------------------------

Red scrap spider is a python based command line application with that performs Data scraping and cleaning as well as text handling and visualizing.
The Idea came from the fact that there are so many job boards out there that it becomes cumbersome for a person to actually search through
and come with a smaller subset of jobs out of a huge array of jobs. This application is aimed at making your search easier by scraping all
job applications online and bringing them to  your command line interface for you to view. It also saves the job = [ Title, company, Location,
link] as a JSON format for developers who might want to make a a site through Angular services.

Support
-------
This application fully supports python 2.7 with full support of python 3.0 coming in the next two weeks.
